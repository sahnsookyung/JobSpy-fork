At Money Forward, we develop a wide range of popular services, including our automated personal financial management tool “Money Forward ME” and the “Money Forward Cloud” suite for businesses. Our ecosystem is powered by advanced technologies such as “Account Aggregation” and our single sign-on system, “Money Forward ID.”

As our services handle sensitive financial data, we maintain the highest standards of security. The CISO Office works closely with our business units to ensure and enhance the security of our products. This includes the governance and visualization of major cloud platforms like AWS and GCP, as well as the design, implementation, and operation of common security features such as WAF. Additionally, the CISO Office is responsible for strengthening the security of our internal information systems.

To provide a safe and secure experience for even more users, we are looking for a Security Specialist to join our team.

About the CISO Office

Our mission is to “Maximize the value delivered to our customers through security.” We define and create the ideal security state for the entire Money Forward Group.

Preventing service downtime and information leakage is, of course, critical. However, that is only one part of what we value. Excessive security measures can slow down development, potentially reducing or delaying the value we provide to our customers. As security professionals, we constantly ask ourselves how we can maximize customer value and implement the most optimized security solutions to achieve that goal.

Security Principles

We consider the ideal state of security and our organization through three core themes:

Embedded security in business strategy. Security does not exist in a vacuum. We design security measures in alignment with business strategies, taking into account the current business phase, costs, projected revenue, and potential loss in the event of a risk.
Advanced balancing between security and experience. The highest level of security is not always the “right” answer. Over-securing can increase costs and compromise user convenience. We must assess risks and always consider the most suitable security measures. Instead of simply avoiding risk, we sometimes choose to take calculated risks to pursue maximum user value. To achieve a sophisticated balance between convenience and security, we actively promote automation and autonomous systems.
Autonomous and scalable organization of security. As the Money Forward Group grows into a larger development organization, we aim to deliver even greater value. If the CISO Office handles every single security function, we will become a bottleneck and fail to scale. Each development department must be able to build secure services autonomously. The CISO Office focuses on building the frameworks and providing the support necessary to enable this autonomy.
Responsibilities

In this position, you will leverage your knowledge and experience in coding and infrastructure to maintain and enhance the security of Money Forward in collaboration with developers and IT infrastructure teams. As a Product Security Specialist, you will drive the following initiatives alongside other security specialists in the CISO Office:

Establishment of security guardrails for AWS, Azure, and GCP environments.
In-house security consulting: Providing technical advice on security and conducting architecture reviews for our developers.
Vulnerability assessments and penetration testing: Performing or supporting security evaluations.
Vulnerability intelligence: Collecting and verifying vulnerability information, including OSINT (Open Source Intelligence).
Security tool development: Developing tools and scripts to automate or enhance security.
Framework implementation: Implementing and deploying security frameworks such as NIST CSF and CIS Controls.
DevSecOps implementation: Integrating security into modern development workflows, including K8s, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines.

The SMB Product Development Division is seeking a strategic and execution-focused AI Program Manager to drive our AI transformation. While your primary initial focus will be leading the AI Innovation Hub, this role is designed for a change agent capable of managing a portfolio of AI initiatives.

Your mission is to act as a bridge between technical potential and business value—stimulating high-quality ideas, incubating them into impactful PoCs, and driving the cultural and operational changes required to make AI a natural part of our engineering, product, and design DNA. You will look beyond single projects to build a sustainable engine for innovation and productivity.

Responsibilities

1. Strategic Program Management & Initiative Leadership

Lead the AI Innovation Hub: Own the roadmap and execution of our SMB internal incubation program, including “Idea & Demo Days” and structured incubation cycles.
Drive Multiple AI Initiatives: Beyond the Hub, identify, scope, and lead ad-hoc strategic AI projects (e.g., specific workflow automations, tool rollouts, or pilot programs) that require cross-functional coordination.
Portfolio Management: Maintain a holistic view of various AI experiments and PoCs across the division to prevent silos, reduce redundancy, and ensure alignment with business goals.

2. Incubation & Experimentation Architecture

Structure Success: Design and refine the end-to-end incubation process (application, selection, validation, milestones) to ensure teams move effectively from loose concepts to “Demo Day-ready” PoCs.
Focus on Impact: Collaborate with technical leaders to ensure initiatives are not just “cool tech,” but are rooted in solving genuine user problems or achieving measurable internal productivity gains.
Advisor Orchestration: Recruit and coordinate a pool of experts (Senior Engineers, AI Specialists, PdMs) to mentor teams, providing the right technical and product guidance at the right time.

3. Change Management & Cultural Transformation

Community Building: Nurture a vibrant, cross-functional AI community. Move beyond simple “engagement” to creating a culture of continuous learning and experimentation.
Best Practice Enablement: Partner with technical leads to translate complex AI capabilities into accessible playbooks, “getting started” guides, and reusable templates for engineers, PdMs, and designers.
Event Management: Plan and execute high-impact events (Hackathons, Demo Days, Sharing Sessions) that celebrate success and inspire broad adoption.

4. Operational Excellence & Continuous Improvement

Measure What Matters: Define and track success metrics not just for the program (participation, completion), but for business impact (adoption rates, time saved, productivity improvements).
Feedback Loops: Actively collect qualitative and quantitative data after every cycle or initiative. Analyze “what worked” and “what didn’t” to iterate on the program structure and the division’s overall AI strategy.
Stakeholder Communication: Keep leadership and cross-functional partners informed on progress, resource requirements, and outcomes.
Requirements

Core Program & Change Management

5+ years of experience in program management, product operations, innovation management, or technical project management.
Change Management: Proven track record of driving adoption of new technologies or processes within a large organization. You know how to influence without direct authority.
Strategic Agility: Ability to switch contexts between high-level strategy (roadmapping, culture building) and tactical execution (event logistics, sprint planning).

Product & Technical Aptitude

Product Development Context: Deep experience working closely with software development teams (Engineering, Product, Design). You understand the software lifecycle (SDLC) and how AI fits into it.
AI Operational Fluency: You view AI through a lens of business value, not just technical novelty. While you don’t need to understand the engineering complexities of how models work (e.g., hallucinations or privacy architecture), you must be adept at consulting with our technical experts to vet feasibility. Your primary role is to bridge the gap: determining if a solution generates real ROI, validating its utility for the business, and managing the operational rollout to ensure adoption.

Leadership & Soft Skills

Facilitation: Excellent communication skills, capable of leading workshops, moderating panels, and articulating a clear vision to senior leadership.
Entrepreneurial Mindset: You are self-driven and proactive. You don’t just run existing programs; you identify gaps and propose new solutions to fill them.
Nice to haves

While not specifically required, tell us if you have any of the following.

Experience running internal startups, accelerators, or corporate innovation labs.
