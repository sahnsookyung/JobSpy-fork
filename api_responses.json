You take end-to-end ownership of complex initiatives \u2014 from understanding the problem and its customer impact, through design and implementation, to validation in production and real-world adoption. We hold a high bar for engineering excellence \u2014 including code quality, system design, security, reliability, and operational maturity \u2014 and consider this a baseline expectation for the role. Meeting this bar is necessary, but not sufficient. Senior engineers are evaluated on the outcomes their work creates for customers and the business, not just on technical sophistication. This is not a role focused on writing code in isolation. Engineering exists to deliver customer value. Technical decisions must balance system health with delivery speed, usability, and impact. Senior engineers are expected to exercise judgment, reason about trade-offs, and prioritize results over technical purity. You will work hands-on across the full development lifecycle, contribute to architectural discussions, and collaborate closely with product, security, and go-to-market teams. In many situations, senior engineers are expected to act as feature-level owners: clarifying ambiguous requirements, modeling solutions from the customer\u2019s perspective, validating assumptions, and ensuring solutions work in real-world conditions. Key Responsibilities - Customer & Product Impact Own features end-to-end, from problem understanding and solution design through release, validation, adoption, and measurable impact. Translate ambiguous customer and business needs into pragmatic, high-quality technical solutions. Make prioritization decisions by explicitly weighing customer value, risk, opportunity cost, and time-to-impact. Ensure features are usable and valuable in real-world scenarios by contributing to documentation, examples, demos, and validation with real customer data. Monitor outcomes after release and iterate based on feedback, metrics, and operational signals. - Technical Execution & System Quality Design, implement, and maintain secure, scalable, and reliable systems as a foundation for customer and business impact. Solve complex technical problems hands-on, improving architecture, performance, observability, and long-term maintainability. Make sound technical decisions that balance correctness, simplicity, and future evolution while avoiding unnecessary complexity. Apply strong engineering fundamentals, including secure coding, testing, and performance optimization in production environments. Use modern development tools and practices to improve delivery speed and quality. - Collaboration, Ownership & Engineering Leadership Raise the engineering bar through code reviews, design discussions, and collaborative problem-solving. Communicate technical concepts, trade-offs, and risks clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Take ownership of outcomes, not just tasks \u2014 proactively identifying risks, gaps, and improvement opportunities. Contribute to continuous improvement of engineering practices, workflows, and tooling with a focus on enabling impact. Model pragmatic, customer-driven engineering behavior in day-to-day work. We value engineers who believe in continuous improvement and are willing to step outside their comfort zone to improve both delivery speed and quality. Successful candidates are confident in their technical skills, pragmatic in their decision-making, and care deeply about reliability, security, and code quality \u2014 while being equally motivated by seeing their work adopted by customers and making a measurable impact. This is a low-drama, high-trust environment where ownership, clarity, and impact matter more than technical heroics. How We Define \u201cDone\u201d For us, success goes beyond shipping code. \u201cDone\u201d is a progression: released validated adopted impactful Senior engineers are expected to own features through all of these stages \u2014 from implementation and release, through real-world validation, to customer adoption and measurable impact. This includes contributing to documentation, examples, demos, instrumentation, and follow-up improvements based on customer feedback and observed usage. Engineers who consider their work complete at release time will likely find this role frustrating.\n\n**\u5fc5\u9808\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb**\n---------\n\n- Several years(5-7 years) of hands-on experience building and operating production systems. - Strong software engineering fundamentals and experience applying modern development practices. - Proven experience owning features or systems beyond initial delivery, including validation, iteration, and real-world usage. - Experience with cloud platforms such as AWS or GCP and modern DevOps practices. - Experience with modern Web Development and JavaScript frameworks (e.g. Vue.js). - Strong understanding of secure coding, scalability, and performance optimization. - Sound engineering judgment and the ability to reason about trade-offs in complex technical and product contexts. - Strong communication skills and professional proficiency in English\u203b \u203b For candidates based in Japan, business-level Japanese proficiency (JLPT N3 or higher) is required.\n\n**\u6b53\u8fce\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb**\n---------\n\n- Experience with Elixir, Erlang, Ruby on Rails, Python/Django, or Scala/Play Framework. - Experience in ad-tech or fraud prevention domains. - Familiarity with big-data technologies such as BigQuery or ClickHouse. - Experience using AI-powered development tools (e.g. code assistants, automated testing, or debugging tools) to improve productivity, code quality, or problem-solving is a plus. - Japanese language proficiency is a plus.\n\n**\u5fdc\u52df\u6982\u8981**\n--------\n\n**\u7d66\u4e0e**\n\nAnnual salary: 5 million-\n\n  \n\n**\u52e4\u52d9\u5730**\n\n107-0062 Tokyo, Minato City, Minamiaoyama, 7 Chome103 Minami Aoyama St Building 4th Floor\n\n  \n\n**\u96c7\u7528\u5f62\u614b**\n\nFull-time\n\n  \n\n**\u52e4\u52d9\u4f53\u7cfb**\n\n-Flexible Working Hours System (Flextime) (Core time: 10:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PM) - Fully two days off per week (Saturday, Sunday, and National Holidays) - Vacation Leave (3 consecutive days in addition to standard annual paid leave) - Year-end and New Year Holidays - Annual Paid Leave - Condolence and Celebration Leave - Childcare Leave - Initial Enrollment Leave (2 days of leave to cover sudden illness, etc., available until statutory paid leave is granted after 6 months) - Vaccination Leave\n\n  \n\n**\u8a66\u7528\u671f\u9593**\n\n3 months\n\n  \n\n**\u798f\u5229\u539a\u751f**\n\n- Stock Options - Annual Salary Increase (Once per year) - Mobile Communication Allowance (\u00a54,200/month) - Influenza Vaccination - Flextime System (Core hours: 10:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PM) - Reimbursement for Job-Related Certification Exams - Babysitter Subsidy (50% coverage, up to \u00a520,000/month) - Premium Friday (Team dinner) - Gold's Gym Membership Subsidy (Employee pays only \u00a5550 per visit)\n\n**\u4f01\u696d\u60c5\u5831**\n--------\n\n**\u4f01\u696d\u540d**\n\n\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793eSpider Labs\n\n  \n\n**\u8a2d\u7acb\u5e74\u6708**\n\n2011\u5e744\u6708\n\n  \n\n**\u672c\u793e\u6240\u5728\u5730**\n\n\u3012107\uff700062 \u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u6e2f\u533a\u5357\u9752\u5c71710\uff13\u5357\u9752\u5c71ST\u30d3\u30eb4\u968e\n\n  \n\n**\u652f\u793e\u6240\u5728\u5730**\n\nAv.

of July 2025, Axelspace\u2019s satellite operations team manages a constellation of five satellites. We began operations at the end of 2018 with the launch of GRUS\u20111A. Through continuous improvement of our operational software, we supported the simultaneous launch and initial operation of GRUS\u20111BCDE in March 2021, and have since conducted routine operations for all five satellites.\n\nInitially, our operations system was almost nonexistent, so we adopted a DevOps approach\u2014our development team also runs the system. Today, we maintain a CI/CD environment that enables routine deployments of operational software. For example, after discovering a minor bug during the first communications pass of GRUS\u20111BCDE, we deployed a fix in time for the second pass. Our end\u2011to\u2011end architecture is designed for resilience to changes, and by releasing small, frequent updates, we simplify validation, troubleshooting, and rollback. We aim to further refine these practices and, together with you, build a scalable, fully automated satellite service.\n\n  \n\n**\u8077\u7a2e / \u52df\u96c6\u30dd\u30b8\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3**\n\nC++ Software engineer (Satellite Operation Systems)\n\n  \n\n**\u96c7\u7528\u5f62\u614b**\n\n\u6b63\u793e\u54e1\n\n  \n\n**\u5951\u7d04\u671f\u9593**\n\nFull-time, permanent position\n\n  \n\n**\u7d66\u4e0e**\n\n\u5fdc\u76f8\u8ac7\n\n\u5831\u916c\uff1aTBD\u3001\u7d4c\u9a13\u53ca\u3073\u80fd\u529b\u306b\u5fdc\u3058\u3066\u9762\u8ac7\u306e\u4e0a\u3001\u63a1\u7528\u6642\u306b\u6c7a\u5b9a\nSalary: TBD, decided upon the candidate's experience and skill set\n\n  \n\n**\u52e4\u52d9\u5730**\n\n103-0023 \u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u4e2d\u592e\u533a\u65e5\u672c\u6a4b\u672c\u753a\u4e09\u4e01\u76ee3\u756a3\u53f7 Clip\u30cb\u30db\u30f3\u30d0\u30b7\u30d3\u30eb  \n\u5730\u56f3\u3067\u78ba\u8a8d\n\nClip Nihonbashi Building, 3\u200c-3-3 Nihonbashi-Honcho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo\n\n  \n\n**\u52e4\u52d9\u6642\u9593**\n\n\u52e4\u52d9\u6642\u9593 \uff1a\u88c1\u91cf\u52b4\u50cd\u5236\nWork Hour: Discretionary Labor Sytem\n\n  \n\n**\u4f11\u65e5**\n\n\u4f11\u65e5\uff1a\u9031\u4f11\uff12\u65e5\u5236\u3001\u795d\u796d\u65e5\n\u4f11\u6687\uff1a\u5e74\u6b21\u6709\u7d66\u4f11\u6687\u3001\u6176\u5f14\u4f11\u6687\u7b49\u30015\u5e74\u5f8c\u30dc\u30fc\u30ca\u30b9\u4f11\u6687\nHoliday: Two-day off per week, National holidays\nPaid Leaves: Annual paid leaves, Congratulatory/Bereavement leaves, 5th-year Bonus leaves\n\n  \n\n**\u798f\u5229\u539a\u751f**\n\n\u901a\u52e4\u624b\u5f53\u652f\u7d66\uff1a\u5b9f\u8cbb\u7cbe\u7b97\n\u5728\u5b85\u52e4\u52d9\u5236\u5ea6\uff1a\u6709\n\u82f1\u4f1a\u8a71\u5b66\u7fd2\u88dc\u52a9\nCommuting Allowance: Actual-cost reimbursement\nRemote Work: Available\nLanguage Support: Japanese class for foreign employees\n\n  \n\n**\u52a0\u5165\u4fdd\u967a**\n\n\u5065\u5eb7\u4fdd\u967a\n\u539a\u751f\u5e74\u91d1\n\u96c7\u7528\u4fdd\u967a\n\u52b4\u707d\u4fdd\u967a\nHealth Insurance\nNational Welfare Pension\nEmployment Insurance\nWorker's Compensation\n\n  \n\n**\u53d7\u52d5\u55ab\u7159\u5bfe\u7b56**\n\n\u6577\u5730\u5185\u7981\u7159\nNo smoking on site\n\n  \n\n**\u8a66\u7528\u671f\u9593**\n\n\u6709\uff083\u30f6\u6708\uff09",
