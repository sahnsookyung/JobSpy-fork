CADDi is on a mission to ""Unleash the potential of manufacturing.""
Launched in 2022, ""CADDi DRAWER"" is a groundbreaking product that uses technologies such as machine learning to structure and link critical design data, considered vital in the manufacturing sector. This innovation transforms this data into valuable informational assets. Already, we have received significant adoption from leading domestic manufacturing companies and machining firms, growing at a pace far exceeding T2D3. In 2023, we expanded our sales efforts to international markets, including the United States, Thailand and Vietnam.

Our vision for the future is to replicate and consolidate manufacturing expertise through technology, extending beyond blueprints to achieve holistic optimization across departments and companies. We aspire to transform our customers' workstyles and cultures, ultimately driving a revolution in the entire manufacturing industry.
Over the next few years, we plan to globally deploy numerous new applications on our platform. Achieving this scale and speed of business expansion requires a foundational platform, robust infrastructure, and unparalleled reliability to support all these applications.

The CADDi Core Division is at the heart of ensuring that the products we continuously create deliver value globally, quickly and reliably. We are looking for an Engineering Manager to maximize the productivity of the development organization within the CADDi Core Division and lead its business growth.

 

Responsibilities

What is an Engineering Manager at CADDi?

Your mission is to maximize the results of the departments and groups you oversee.
Setting OKRs to chart the course forward and perform necessary management tasks by working backward from our desired future state.
The role of an EM is not rigidly defined; we believe the approach to achieving results should align with each individual's strengths. For example, some excel at empowering others to drive outcomes, while others lead design and policy decisions directly on the ground. The balance between technology management, project management, product management, and people management also varies depending on each EM's assigned domain and key focus areas.

This recruitment position is primarily for leading a team involved in application development and platform development. The team is composed of members from multiple countries and operates as a global team.

Setting and managing team goals aligned with business strategy and product vision.
Developing team members through 1-on-1 meetings, performance evaluations, and feedback sessions.
Driving recruitment initiatives and external communications to strengthen our engineering brand.
Designing organizational structures optimized for scaling the product and business.
Planning and implementing effective information-sharing processes to enhance productivity in a bilingual (Japanese and English) environment.
Identifying issues, proposing initiatives, and executing measures aimed at maximizing the value and effectiveness of the engineering organization.

 

About the position

You will be responsible for managing platform service development within the CADDi Core Division, which oversees the common infrastructure (including goal setting for your assigned domain and various management activities to achieve those goals).

The mission of the CADDi Core Division is to develop and expand platform services that bear responsibility for solving common technical challenges across applications, thereby driving the overall business growth of CADDi through the power of its technological foundation.

※ The following tasks are not handled by a single manager at once; responsibilities are divided based on assigned areas, current priorities, and individual strengths and preferences.

Promoting Platform Servitization: Planning, development, and operational policy management for foundational services independent of business logic
Advancing Platform Engineering: Developing and providing platforms and tools to enhance company-wide developer experience (DX)
Close collaboration with EMs and Product Managers in application development organizations
People Management for Development Teams: Recruitment, Development, Evaluation, Organizational Design, etc.
Formulation and Execution of Technical Strategy: Selecting appropriate technologies and optimizing infrastructure costs based on business phase and ROI

 

Examples of areas of responsibility

File Platform: Responsible for unifying file upload and download functionality required by multiple applications.
Workflow Engine: Responsible for providing the execution foundation to perform large-scale batch processing in a defined sequence.
Additionally, develops and provides foundational services to resolve technical challenges within applications.
If your interests or strengths lie closer to the application layer, you may also be assigned to manage the Reliability domain (which includes SRE, QA, and Product Security) within the application development organization.

Around 30% of our development team members come from various international backgrounds, including Asia, Europe, and North America. To build a thriving multicultural environment, some teams communicate primarily in English, and critical meetings are held bilingually in both Japanese and English.

As a manager, you’ll be responsible for leading diverse, multinational teams. Depending on your experience and organizational needs, you may manage one or multiple teams. The exact team(s) you’ll oversee will be decided based on your expertise and preferences discussed during interviews and will be presented during the offer stage.

Internal communication within teams is primarily in English, whereas communication across teams involves a mix of Japanese and English, but a high level of Japanese proficiency isn't necessary.

This role provides you with opportunities to tackle challenging problems alongside passionate colleagues, contribute to a product that’s reshaping industry structures and creating social impact, participate in scaling a global product and international engineering organization, and experience significant professional growth by working closely with experienced leaders, including former CTOs of publicly listed SaaS companies.

※ Based on your experience and preferences, you will be expected to manage either a single team or multiple teams immediately upon joining.

※ Alternatively, you may start by actively contributing hands-on for several months to deepen your technical understanding, build relationships with stakeholders, and gradually transition into management duties.

※ Regarding your initial responsibilities:
We will propose your assigned area during the offer discussion, referencing the preferences and strengths discussed during the casual meeting and interviews.
We also look forward to discussing the details of each organization during the casual meeting.

 

About development organization

Our team includes top-tier technical leaders in Japan, such as CTO Kobashi, ex-Apple US Headquarters, and VPoE Fujikura, former CTO of Sansan.
We are tackling an unprecedented mission: fundamentally transforming an entire industry. That's why we've cultivated a culture that embraces the unfinished and challenges the unimaginable future. We prioritize unlocking individual potential, inspiring each other to build a development organization that delivers greater value to customers faster, and collectively create a world-class development platform to support it.

While deepening expertise in foundational domains, you can also envision a future career leading larger organizations.
Challenge in a Global Development Structure
As our business globalizes, our development organization is diversifying. You'll gain dynamic experience building and operating infrastructure across multiple regions, and creating a world-class platform alongside developers from around the globe.

Proficiency in development flow based on git and GitHub
8+ years of experience in Software Engineering or a similar role, with preferably experience in Golang
Strong sense of testing, including unit tests and integration tests
Ability to communicate recommendations for improvements on current systems, processes, and services as needed
Exhibit a strong ability to adapt in a dynamic and ever-changing environment
Ability to solve problems, especially to identify the source of the problem, and create and test solutions
Proven team-leading experience with the ability to mentor and guide team members

exaBase Studio is a development platform designed to bring operations teams and developers closer together. By integrating internal and external AI models, services, and data, it enables the seamless creation of AI software.

 

Fast, Simple Development with Room for Gradual Improvements

Many companies face the dilemma of wanting to improve their systems using feedback from the field, but being unable to do so due to the heavy burden of redesigning system architectures or upgrading infrastructure for production-level systems.
exaBase Studio addresses this challenge by providing a simple, visual UI that allows anyone to build AI software. This empowers teams to move projects forward without being constrained by resource or organizational limitations. Furthermore, the AI technologies embedded within exaBase Studio are continuously updated with cutting-edge advancements, thanks to our accumulated expertise. This ensures you can always leverage the latest AI capabilities.

 

Seamless API Integration of Internal and External Data

With exaBase Studio, you can integrate various datasets, including those previously downloaded and processed from external tools, as well as proprietary internal company data. This significantly reduces manual workload and allows users to create models or business improvement applications tailored to specific datasets.

This development platform is driving the creation of AI implementation use cases across diverse industries and domains to transform business operations. Responding to the growing demand for such innovations, we are looking for team members who can help turn these needs into actionable solutions. At the same time, you will help establish standardized offerings for AI development using exaBase Studio.

 

The Vision Behind exaBase Studio

A Platform to Break Through the ""PoC Deadlock"" and Bring AI to Real-World Implementation

Many AI projects stall at the PoC (Proof of Concept) stage and fail to move into practical application. Challenges such as ""achieving high accuracy but struggling to integrate it into a system,"" ""burdensome operational requirements,"" or ""insufficient IT resources to embed AI"" often prevent promising technologies from being realized in the field.
exaBase Studio is designed to overcome this ""PoC deadlock"" by transforming AI into functional products that operate effectively in real-world environments. Through a GUI-based development platform, it enables rapid systemization of AI models from the PoC stage and adapts them to enterprise environments. This makes it possible to create AI solutions that are not just developed, but actively used in business operations.

 

Democratizing AI-Powered Business App Development: Delivering Value at Unprecedented Speed

AI is often perceived as a tool reserved for engineers, but exaBase Studio takes a radically different approach. It is a development platform built to usher in an era where ""anyone can integrate AI into their business operations."" By leveraging a low-code/no-code environment, users without specialized AI knowledge can deploy solutions to production environments within weeks. Those on the front lines of business can design, test, and implement AI-driven improvements themselves. This unmatched speed and flexibility are fundamentally transforming the traditional AI adoption process.

 

Breaking Down Barriers to AI Adoption and Driving Cross-Industry Transformation

AI is no longer a ""specialized technology reserved for large enterprises."" Its potential is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, finance, energy, healthcare, and logistics. However, the key challenge remains: ""How can AI be effectively implemented and managed?""
exaBase Studio serves as a solution to this challenge. It enables the deployment of AI applications that would traditionally take a year to develop in as little as a few weeks. This speed and agility are accelerating cross-industry transformations, breaking down the barriers to AI adoption, and empowering organizations of all sizes to unlock the full potential of AI.

The SMB Product Development Division is seeking a strategic and execution-focused AI Program Manager to drive our AI transformation. While your primary initial focus will be leading the AI Innovation Hub, this role is designed for a change agent capable of managing a portfolio of AI initiatives.

Your mission is to act as a bridge between technical potential and business value—stimulating high-quality ideas, incubating them into impactful PoCs, and driving the cultural and operational changes required to make AI a natural part of our engineering, product, and design DNA. You will look beyond single projects to build a sustainable engine for innovation and productivity.

 

Responsibilities and Duties

1. Strategic Program Management & Initiative Leadership

Lead the AI Innovation Hub: Own the roadmap and execution of our SMB internal incubation program, including ""Idea & Demo Days"" and structured incubation cycles.
Drive Multiple AI Initiatives: Beyond the Hub, identify, scope, and lead ad-hoc strategic AI projects (e.g., specific workflow automations, tool rollouts, or pilot programs) that require cross-functional coordination.
Portfolio Management: Maintain a holistic view of various AI experiments and PoCs across the division to prevent silos, reduce redundancy, and ensure alignment with business goals.

2. Incubation & Experimentation Architecture

Structure Success: Design and refine the end-to-end incubation process (application, selection, validation, milestones) to ensure teams move effectively from loose concepts to ""Demo Day-ready"" PoCs.
Focus on Impact: Collaborate with technical leaders to ensure initiatives are not just ""cool tech,"" but are rooted in solving genuine user problems or achieving measurable internal productivity gains.
Advisor Orchestration: Recruit and coordinate a pool of experts (Senior Engineers, AI Specialists, PdMs) to mentor teams, providing the right technical and product guidance at the right time.

3. Change Management & Cultural Transformation

Community Building: Nurture a vibrant, cross-functional AI community. Move beyond simple ""engagement"" to creating a culture of continuous learning and experimentation.
Best Practice Enablement: Partner with technical leads to translate complex AI capabilities into accessible playbooks, ""getting started"" guides, and reusable templates for engineers, PdMs, and designers.
Event Management: Plan and execute high-impact events (Hackathons, Demo Days, Sharing Sessions) that celebrate success and inspire broad adoption.

4. Operational Excellence & Continuous Improvement

Measure What Matters: Define and track success metrics not just for the program (participation, completion), but for business impact (adoption rates, time saved, productivity improvements).
Feedback Loops: Actively collect qualitative and quantitative data after every cycle or initiative. Analyze ""what worked"" and ""what didn't"" to iterate on the program structure and the division’s overall AI strategy.
Stakeholder Communication: Keep leadership and cross-functional partners informed on progress, resource requirements, and outcomes.

 

Required Skills and Experience

Core Program & Change Management

5+ years of experience in program management, product operations, innovation management, or technical project management.
Change Management: Proven track record of driving adoption of new technologies or processes within a large organization. You know how to influence without direct authority.
Strategic Agility: Ability to switch contexts between high-level strategy (roadmapping, culture building) and tactical execution (event logistics, sprint planning).

Product & Technical Aptitude

Product Development Context: Deep experience working closely with software development teams (Engineering, Product, Design). You understand the software lifecycle (SDLC) and how AI fits into it.
AI Operational Fluency: You view AI through a lens of business value, not just technical novelty. While you don't need to understand the engineering complexities of how models work (e.g., hallucinations or privacy architecture), you must be adept at consulting with our technical experts to vet feasibility. Your primary role is to bridge the gap: determining if a solution generates real ROI, validating its utility for the business, and managing the operational rollout to ensure adoption.

Leadership & Soft Skills

Facilitation: Excellent communication skills, capable of leading workshops, moderating panels, and articulating a clear vision to senior leadership.
Entrepreneurial Mindset: You are self-driven and proactive. You don't just run existing programs; you identify gaps and propose new solutions to fill them.

 

Preferred Skills and Experience

Experience running internal startups, accelerators, or corporate innovation labs.
Experience measuring productivity metrics (e.g., SPACE framework, DORA metrics) in an engineering context.
Technical background (CS degree or coding bootcamp) is a plus, but not required if you have strong technical literacy.

 

Language Requirements

Business level English
(Nice to have) Conversational or business level Japanese.

 

Work Environment

At Money Forward, we provide an environment where we can create world-class services together, and we are looking forward to welcoming you.

Provided PC Specs: We provide PCs equipped with the latest CPUs (MacOS or Windows). Custom-made PCs tailored to business requirements and replacements with the latest OS are also possible.
