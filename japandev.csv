At Money Forward, we develop a wide range of popular services, including our automated personal financial management tool ""Money Forward ME"" and the ""Money Forward Cloud"" suite for businesses. Our ecosystem is powered by advanced technologies such as ""Account Aggregation"" and our single sign-on system, ""Money Forward ID.""

As our services handle sensitive financial data, we maintain the highest standards of security. The CISO Office works closely with our business units to ensure and enhance the security of our products. This includes the governance and visualization of major cloud platforms like AWS and GCP, as well as the design, implementation, and operation of common security features such as WAF. Additionally, the CISO Office is responsible for strengthening the security of our internal information systems.

To provide a safe and secure experience for even more users, we are looking for a Security Specialist to join our team.

 

About the CISO Office

Our mission is to ""Maximize the value delivered to our customers through security."" We define and create the ideal security state for the entire Money Forward Group.

Preventing service downtime and information leakage is, of course, critical. However, that is only one part of what we value. Excessive security measures can slow down development, potentially reducing or delaying the value we provide to our customers. As security professionals, we constantly ask ourselves how we can maximize customer value and implement the most optimized security solutions to achieve that goal.

 

Security Principles

Embedded security in business strategy: We design security measures in alignment with business strategies, taking into account the current business phase, costs, and potential loss in the event of a risk.
Advanced balancing between security and experience: Over-securing can compromise user convenience. We assess risks to achieve a sophisticated balance between convenience and security, actively promoting automation and autonomous systems.
Autonomous and scalable organization of security: Each development department must be able to build secure services autonomously. The CISO Office focuses on building the frameworks and support necessary to enable this autonomy.

 

Responsibilities and Duties

In this position, you will leverage your knowledge and experience in coding and infrastructure to maintain and enhance the security of Money Forward in collaboration with developers and IT infrastructure teams. Key initiatives include:

Establishment of security guardrails for AWS, Azure, and GCP environments.

Required Skills and Experience

Foundational understanding of computer science (networking, OS, data structures, and cryptography).
Experience in software development with at least one programming language, or hands-on experience practicing Security by Design.
Business-level English communication skills.
Knowledge or experience in any of the following areas:
Vulnerability assessment or Penetration testing
Forensics, malware analysis, or incident response

Preferred Skills and Experience

Business-level Japanese communication skills.
Experience participating in CTFs, bug hunting, or obtaining CVEs.
Relevant certifications such as CISSP, CISM, OSCP, or GCIH.
Deep understanding of Authentication and Authorization (e.g., OIDC, OAuth).

Benefits

There are currently no comparable projects in the world that collect data and develop foundation models on such a large scale. As mentioned above, this is one of Japan’s leading national projects, supported by a substantial investment of 20.5 billion yen from NEDO.

This position will play a crucial role in determining the success of the project. You will have broad discretion and responsibility, and we are confident that, if successful, you will gain both a great sense of achievement and the opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to society.

Furthermore, we strongly encourage engineers to actively build their careers through this project—for example, by publishing research papers and engaging in academic activities.","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
